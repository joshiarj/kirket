### Question came up as most people I've talked to, and who watch cricket semi-regularly, have noted how Joe Root ends up batting pretty much run a ball however much he scores these days. What happened to the good old days of getting your eye in for a while, playing super slow in the nervous 90s, and then going all out once you get to your 100. 

# Requirements: 
## I'll be doing this in Python 2.7 with package requirements added on as I go on.
